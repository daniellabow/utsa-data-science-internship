# UTSA Data Science Internship Projects

Welcome to my project repository for the **UTSA Data Science & AI Community Innovation Scholars Program**. Over the course of this 10-week internship, I'm working with real-world datasets and sharpening my Python, data analysis, and problem-solving skills to support community-focused nonprofits.

## Projects

Each of these beginner-friendly Python scripts reflects key skills developed during the internship, such as logic building, algorithmic thinking, and basic data analysis.

### 📟 Dan's Calculator
A simple Python calculator script that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### 🔢 Dan's Fibonacci
Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-defined limit using a loop-based approach.

### 📅 Dan's Leap Year Calculator
A quick tool to determine whether a given year is a leap year, based on logical conditions in Python.

### 🚢 Dan's Titanic Dataset
A basic data analysis script using the Titanic dataset. Demonstrates data handling, exploration.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or standard Python scripts
- Pandas, NumPy

## About the Internship

This repository is part of my work with the **UTSA Data Science and AI Community Innovation Scholars Program**, in collaboration with local nonprofits. The goal is to apply data science methods to support meaningful causes and build technical experience in the process.
